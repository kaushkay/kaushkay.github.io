With the increasing craze of Artificial Intelligence, we also got involved in spreading some knowledge about Deep Learning by conducting this 3-day Workshop.
In this Workshop, we taught the basics of Neural Networks on
## Day 1

![pic2](/assets/images/icw_2019/pic2.jpg){: style="float:center"}

In Neural networks, we taught about the following topics :
1. What/Why Neural Networks?
2. Neuron: Biological Inspiration for Computation.
3. Regression vs Classification
4. Deep Learning Tools (Tensorflow, PyTorch, etc.)
5. Data Augmentation, Overfitting, Mini-Batch size.
6. Forward propagation, Backward propagation, Loss Functions, etc.
7. Different types of Activation function.
8. Regularization Methods
9. Normalization
10. One small Project.
