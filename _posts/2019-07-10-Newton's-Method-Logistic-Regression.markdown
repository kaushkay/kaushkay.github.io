## What is the Classification Problem ?
In Machine Learning and statistics, classification is the problem of detecting / identifying to which of a set of categories (or sub-populations) a new observation belongs, on the basis of the training set of the data containing obseravations (or instances) whose category membership (or labels) are known. Examples of Classification Problem

The Newton's Method can be used in place of Simple Logistic Regression Algorithm. It can be used to maximize the log likelihood function, $l(\theta)$ .
