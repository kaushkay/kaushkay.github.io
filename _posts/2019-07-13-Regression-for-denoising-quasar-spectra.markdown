A quasar can be defined as an extremely Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN). AN AGN is nothing more than a supermassive black hole that is active and feeding at the center of a galaxy. They are extremely bright and sometimes mistaken for stars. However, the energy output of a star is nowhere near the amount of energy pumped out by a quasar. The word “quasar” originates from the contraction of “quasi-stellar”, which references a star-like radio source.

### Properties of Quasars : 
The electromagnetic spectrum gives us the range of frequencies of different electromagnetic waves and their respective wavelengths. There are different electromagnetic wave regions, based on their frequency.

Quasars are known to emit electromagnetic radiation, which lies between the visible and X-ray regions. They also emit large amounts of ultraviolet waves.

Quasar Spectra for "Messier 31" Galaxy is shown below :
